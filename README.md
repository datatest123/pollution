# How to view this project 

The main file in this project is the "ToxicReleases.pdf" that contains a report on toxic releases 
in the US. I recommend downloading the pdf or opening it in your browser as opposed to opening it on 
GitHub because the formatting is worse in the GitHub viewer. 

The R scripts I made to create both the report and the csvs are stored in the "scripts" folder. The EPA
TRI data I acquired for this project is stored along with some custom csvs in the "CSVs" folder. The 
R Markdown file containing the code used to generate the report is provided in the "scripts" folder. 

The EPA TRI Program documentation is provided as "EPA_TRI_documentation.pdf".
