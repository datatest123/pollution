# How to view this project

The main part of this project is the report given in the "ToxicReleases.pdf" file. I recommend 
downloading it and viewing it in your browser or pdf reader software. The GitHub viewer introduces
some formatting errors that are not present when the file is viewed elsewhere. 

The csvs I acquired from the EPA TRI program, along with several csvs I created during the project,
are stored in the CSVs folder. The R scripts used to make the report are stored in the scripts folder. 

The TRI documentation is provided in "LCD_documentation.pdf" for reference.
